Final Project Idea
Gabriel Harris

Why:
Over that past year, we have had a few public incidents that caused previous racial lines to be examined. Although racism has for the most part been eradicated, it is obviously still prevalent in parts of our society. The police brutality cases from this past year headlined much of the news for months being widely broadcasted on multiple news channels with live debates. This headline news, much like most other popular topics, took over social media news streams as well. Different types of posts of support of the black community were seen across the web with hashtags such as #blacklivesmatter. This social media outburst was expected if you consider the fluidity and prominence of social media platforms and the underlying racial tension that exist in today’s society. This underlying racial tension is inevitable because of our nation’s blemished history regarding race and human rights. That being said, our society has made great progress in this social dilemma, but I think social media, in many ways, facilitates an eternal lifeline for traditional prejudices and racial stereotypes.

What?

I want to examine the pattern of social media activity in regards to racial biases in sports. Sports is a major subject in most American’s lives. Most basic topics of conversation can have a sports’ relation. Along with this fact, headline news outlets depend on sports updates for daily content. Sports is a constant in American life because of its all-inclusive popularity, but also because it produces daily matters to think and discuss. People need subject matter to dialogue with others or come up with ideas. Professional athletes are heavily debated ranging from their personal romantic relationships to their publicly announced financial statuses. Sports headlines are discussed in a similar frequency, but in a much larger magnitude than our other daily constants such as weather and traffic. Topics only matter if they are discussed by large groups of people or by important people. Social media outlets, such as Twitter, has forever modernized the method people receive their news and the ability to liberally express ourselves to the public, but I think it also gives people a place to selective emphasize on particular public issues which keeps underlying racial biases alive.
If an issue or topic goes viral on social media, the topic will have simultaneously reached countless news feed, notifications, friends’ pages, etc. Urban dictionary defines viral (media) as “a website or video that has become instantly famous overnight via YouTube or other popular media.” Athlete news are typical daily headlines, but it seems headlines that involve negative stereotypical activity go viral the most often. Stereotypes such as “all black people are athletic” or “all black people steal” are the type of underlying racial thoughts that I think are being perpetuated by social media. Recently in the news, Kurt Busch, a Nascar driver, was suspended for allegedly choking his girlfriend (Quiet article).

This topic was quietly discussed on sports broadcast shows with a few national headlines for the day or so. This issue may have made two days, no more than three days, of the news cycle with a few social media contribution which comes primarily from the official sources’ accounts. However, if you compare this quiet social media conversation versus how the Ray Rice (http://www.tmz.com/videos/0_ekaflcqq/) or Adrian Peterson’s personal lives were dismantled by social media (note the difference of the popularity of the source) demonstrates the difference in highlighted topics. 
If compared, the domestic violence acts of Busch and Rice were quite similar. It is understandable that Rice’s situation blew up because of the elevator footage; but throughout the public prosecution process, he had unwavering support from his girlfriend, who also was publicly bashed on social media (#whyistayed). This fact is revealing if you compare Rice’s and Busch’s girlfriend actions. Busch’s girlfriend basically issues a public cry for help in a recent interview:
Driscoll said. “And then, for him to pop out of bed and grab me by the throat and smash my head into the wall three times and my son is in the front. I don’t understand why he snapped like that.”
“I’ve had a lot of women come forward to me, from the NASCAR community, to say they were also abused and that they’re being harassed by other team members.” Driscoll says. “That when they’ve gone to get protective orders and they’ve received them, that they’re still getting harassed by their ex-husbands or ex-boyfriends or the guys that he works with because unlike a lot of sports they all live in the same community.”

Statements such as these bring the attention to sad trues of the sports world, but also our society as a whole. I think by scraping and examining the Twitter (or maybe Instagrams API) for related types of input about topics such as the mentioned topic. 
Method:
-	Examine the social media activity around:
o	Kurt Busch vs. Ray Rice (or Ray McDonald) – domestic violence
o	Johnny Manziel vs. Gordon – drug issues
 
-	Scrape the Twitter API for
o	For relatable hashtags
o	Retweeted stories
o	Amount of input by major new source accounts (ESPN, CNN, ABC, etc.)
o	Amount of input by other pro athletes/ celebrities
-	Collect and gather articles regarding the two stories
o	NY Times, ESPN, Buzzfeed
o	Scrape the number of tweets, hashtags, and other social media input (input gathered from the Twitter scrape) used in articles
o	Note source of input (from main source, other high status, or random)
-	Examine the Twitter feedback
o	Count and compare number of hashtags
o	Measure the time frame of a hashtag
o	Count and compare number retweets
o	Count and compare number of hashtags by major new source account
o	Compare the news sources results
o	Examine where most of the racial tension is fostering and why (maybe?)
